    "   For instance by running `cd <project_dir>`.\n",

    "3. **Create a virtual environment.**  \n",
    "   Using the locally-installed version of python (see prerequisites), `python -m venv env`\n",

    "   `source <env_dir>/bin/activate`.  \n",
    "   Now, python, pip, etc will all refer to the versions installed in the virtual\n",

    "6. **Install a compatible version of `jax`.**  \n",
    "   It is very easy to install JAX using `pip`, in any case follow the\n",
    "   instructions in the [JAX README](https://github.com/google/jax#installation)\n",
    "   to install JAX and its dependencies in the virtual environment.\n",

    "   The remaining dependencies (including Flax) can be installed by running\n",
    "   `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. **Clone the starter code into the project directory.**  \n",
    "  Specifically, `git clone https://github.com/alexjackson1/examples.git .` will \n",
